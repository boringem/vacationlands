# Overview
By creating a digital version of the 1946 Union Pacific “Western Vacationlands” brochure, this project specifically aims to provide a broad introduction to popular narratives around the history of the American West through the lens of passenger rail travel. As such, it was designed to intentionally mimic the aesthetics and language of modern destination websites. These websites are often used as a jumping off point for trip planning today in much the same way this brochure served as a jumping off point for planning a train trip.

The illustrations and all text comes from a personal copy of the Union Pacific Western Vacationlands brochure from 1946. The images were scanned in color at 400 dots per inch. While the illustrations themselves are unsigned, the illustrated map on the back of the brochure is signed Willmarth, likely referring to William Willmarth, who did illustration for Union Pacific from the 1930s until the 1950s (Zega & Gruber, 126). Union Pacific hired Willmarth’s Studio in Omaha for a good portion of their promotional materials during this time frame, and it would make sense that the rest of the brochure is also their work.
